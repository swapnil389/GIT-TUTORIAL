## METHODOLOGIES

### WATERFALL : 
Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development. It's called "waterfall" because it flows steadily downwards through distinct phases, each of which must be completed before moving on to the next.

### Benefits
- Clear Structure: Each phase has a clear start and end, making it easy to manage and track progress.
- Documentation: Extensive documentation in the early phases helps clarify requirements and design.
- Predictability: Fixed project timelines and deliverables provide a predictable project lifecycle.
### Drawbacks :
- Inflexibility: Difficult to accommodate changes once the project is underway.
- Late Testing: Testing occurs late in the process, which can lead to the discovery of significant issues after considerable work has already been done.
- No Overlapping Phases: Phases are strictly sequential, which can lead to delays if one phase takes longer than expected.
- 
### AGILE (FLEXIBLE) : 
Agile methodology is a project management approach that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It emphasizes iterative development, where work is completed in small, manageable increments known as sprints.

### Frameworks within Agile:
- Scrum: Focuses on sprints, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews/retrospectives.
- Kanban: Visualizes work on a board, emphasizing continuous delivery without fixed sprints.
- Extreme Programming (XP): Emphasizes technical excellence, including practices like pair programming and test-driven development.
### Benefits :
- Increased Flexibility: Teams can quickly adapt to changes in requirements.
- Improved Collaboration: Regular communication within teams and with stakeholders.
- Higher Quality: Continuous testing and feedback loops enhance software quality.
- Faster Delivery: Regular, incremental releases of working software.
